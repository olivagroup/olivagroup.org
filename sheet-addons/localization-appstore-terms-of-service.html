      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 23 Dec 2024</p>

      <p>Welcome to the Localization for App Store Connect App Version By OLIVA add-on ("the Service"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>

      <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
      <p>The Service is provided to help you translate specific fields within your Google Sheets document related to your App Store Connect data. You agree to use the Service solely for lawful purposes and in accordance with the instructions provided. You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your Google Sheets document and any data you provide, including your JWT token.</p>

      <h2>2. Data You Provide</h2>
      <p>To use the Service, you must provide a JWT token, which is used to authenticate access to your App Store Connect data. This token is inputted into your Google Sheets document and is used solely for the purpose of accessing your data for translation purposes. The data within your Google Sheets (such as 'What’s New', 'Keywords', 'Promotional Text', 'App Description') remains within your Google Sheets account, and we do not store or access any other personal information.</p>

      <h2>3. Restrictions</h2>
      <p>You agree not to use the Service in any way that could:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the operation of the Service.</li>
        <li>Infringe the rights of others, including intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. No Data Storage</h2>
      <p>We do not store or retain any personal or application data provided through the Service. All data interactions occur in real-time during your use of the Service. Once your session ends, we do not keep any of your data, including the JWT token you provided.</p>

      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <p>While we strive to maintain the security of the Service, you acknowledge that no system is entirely secure. You are responsible for ensuring the security of your JWT token and Google Sheets document. We do not store or share your JWT token beyond its use in your session, and your data within Google Sheets is governed by Google’s security policies.</p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The Service integrates with Google Sheets to perform its function. Google Sheets is subject to Google's terms of service and privacy policy. We do not share your data with any third-party services outside of Google Sheets. By using the Service, you consent to the data processing practices of Google.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Control</h2>
      <p>You maintain full control over the data stored within your Google Sheets document. You can modify, delete, or add data as needed. You can also remove or update your JWT token at any time.</p>

      <h2>8. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or if we need to comply with legal obligations. You may also discontinue your use of the Service at any time.</p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages arising out of your use or inability to use the Service, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>

      <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless OLIVA, its affiliates, employees, and partners from and against any claims, losses, damages, or expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service or any violation of these Terms.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. If we make significant changes to the Terms, we will notify users within the app or by email. The updated Terms will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" will be updated accordingly.</p>

      <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which OLIVA operates, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

      <h2>13. Contact Information</h2>
