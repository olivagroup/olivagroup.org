      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <nav><a href="../sheet-addons.html">← Back to Sheet Add-ons</a></nav>

      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 23 Dec 2024</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Thank you for using the Localization for App Store Connect App Version By OLIVA add-on ("the Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information while using the Service, and outlines your rights and choices regarding that information. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>The Service does not collect or store any private information. The only data you provide is the JWT token you enter into your Google Sheets to enable the add-on to interact with your App Store Connect data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>JWT Token:</strong> You must input a JWT token into the Google Sheets document to use the Service. This token is provided by you, the user, and is solely used to authenticate your access to App Store Connect data. We do not store or retain this token beyond the current session, and it is never shared or exposed to any third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Sheets Data:</strong> The Service works with data within your Google Sheets document, specifically the fields related to your App Store Connect version that you want translated, such as 'What's New', 'Keywords', 'Promotional Text', and 'App Description'. This data remains in your Google Sheets, and we do not access or store any other personal data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Google User Data</h2>
      <p>The Service does not collect or store Google user data beyond the JWT token you provide. All Google Sheets data remains within your Google Sheets document, and we do not access or use data outside of the specific fields relevant to your App Store Connect version translation.</p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information you provide only to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Translate the fields in your Google Sheets document related to your App Store Connect version (e.g., 'What's New', 'Keywords', 'Promotional Text', 'App Description').</li>
        <li>No data storage: We do not store any of your personal or application data. All interactions are done in real-time during the use of the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of your data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>JWT Token:</strong> The JWT token you input into your Google Sheets is used solely for authenticating access to App Store Connect data. This token is processed directly in Google Sheets and is not transmitted to or stored by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Sheets Security:</strong> The data in your Google Sheets is stored securely by Google, and access to it is subject to Google's security measures and privacy policies. We do not store any personal information or JWT tokens on our servers, nor do we share any data with third parties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We do not share your data with any third-party services, except for Google Sheets, which is required for the operation of the add-on. Google Sheets is governed by Google’s privacy policy, which you can review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>We do not retain any of your data. The JWT token you provide is only used for the duration of your session, and once the task is complete, the token is no longer needed. You have full control over your data stored within your Google Sheets document, and you can delete or modify this data at any time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete your JWT token and any other data related to your use of the Service at any time. You have complete control over the content in your Google Sheets.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Control Over JWT Token:</strong> You can remove or update your JWT token at any time in the Google Sheets document.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Over Google Sheets Data:</strong> You have complete control over the data in your Google Sheets. You can add, modify, or delete the data as needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Protection and Sensitive Data</h2>
      <p>We do not process or store sensitive data through this Service. The JWT token and your Google Sheets data are handled securely and are never shared with third parties.</p>

      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect any changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. Any updates to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" will be updated accordingly. If we make significant changes, we will notify users within the app or by email.</p>
